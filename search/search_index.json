Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) uses a pair of organic dyes as reporters to measure distances along a predefined biomolecular reaction coordinate. For this nanoscopic ruler to work, the fluorescent labels need to be coupled onto the molecule of interest in a bioorthogonal and site-selective manner. Tagging large non-coding RNAs with single-nucleotide precision is an open challenge. Here we summarize current strategies in labeling riboswitches and ribozymes for fluorescence spectroscopy and FRET in particular. A special focus lies on our recently developed, DNA-guided approach that inserts two fluorophores through a stepwise process of templated functionality transfer and click chemistry. </p> <p>M.

Here we present a novel covalent labeling approach that is site-specific and scalable to long intricately folded RNAs. In this approach, a custom-designed DNA strand that hybridizes to the RNA guides a reactive group to target a preselected adenine residue. The functionalized nucleotide along with the concomitantly oxidized 3'-terminus can subsequently be conjugated to two different fluorophores via bio-orthogonal chemistry. We validate this modular labeling platform using a regulatory RNA of 275 nucleotides, the btuB riboswitch of Escherichia coli, demonstrate its general applicability by modifying a base within a duplex, and show its site-selectivity in targeting a pair of adjacent adenines. Native folding and function of the RNA is confirmed on the single-molecule level by using FRET as a sensor to visualize and characterize the conformational equilibrium of the riboswitch upon binding of its cofactor adenosylcobalamin. The presented labeling strategy overcomes size and site constraints that have hampered routine production of labeled RNA that are beyond 200 nt in length. </p>"},{"location":"publications/fretraj/","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"publications/fretraj/#fretraj","title":"FRETraj","text":"<p>F.

Using either all-atom or implicit fluorophore modeling, we recreate FRET experiments in silico, visualize the underlying structural dynamics and quantify the reaction coordinates. Using multiple accessible-contact volumes as a post hoc scoring method for fragment assembly in Rosetta, we demonstrate that FRET can be used to filter a de novo RNA structure prediction ensemble by refuting models that are not compatible with in vitro FRET measurement. We benchmark our FRET-assisted modeling approach on double-labeled DNA strands and validate it against an intrinsically dynamic manganese(II)-binding riboswitch. We show that a FRET coordinate describing the assembly of a four-way junction allows our pipeline to recapitulate the global fold of the riboswitch displayed by the crystal structure.

Occasional excursions to a non-fluorescent cis-state hint at the remarkable sensitivity of carbocyanines to their local environment. Comparison of time-correlated single photon experiments with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the propensity of photoisomerization is dictated by sterical constraints imposed on the fluorophore.

A popular implementation is single-molecule F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET), for which total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy is frequently combined with camera-based detection of surface-immobilized molecules. Camera-based smFRET experiments generate large and complex datasets and several methods for video processing and analysis have been reported. As these algorithms often address similar aspects in video analysis, there is a growing need for standardized comparison. Here, we present a Matlab-based software (MASH-FRET) that allows for the simulation of camera-based smFRET videos, yielding standardized data sets suitable for benchmarking video processing algorithms. The software permits to vary parameters that are relevant in cameras-based smFRET, such as video quality, and the properties of the system under study. Experimental noise is modeled taking into account photon statistics and camera noise. Finally, we survey how video test sets should be designed to evaluate currently available data analysis strategies in camera-based sm fluorescence experiments. We complement our study by pre-optimizing and evaluating spot detection algorithms using our simulated video test sets. </p>"},{"location":"publications/mash-fret/#transition-analysis","title":"Transition analysis","text":"<p>M.C.A.S.

A popular implementation of smFRET consists of recording fluorescence intensity time traces of surface-immobilized, chromophore-tagged molecules. This approach generates large and complex data sets, the analysis of which is to date not standardized. Here, we address a key challenge in smFRET data analysis: the generation of thermodynamic and kinetic models that describe with statistical rigor the behavior of FRET trajectories recorded from surface-tethered biomolecules in terms of the number of FRET states, the corresponding mean FRET values, and the kinetic rates at which they interconvert. For this purpose, we first perform Monte Carlo simulations to generate smFRET trajectories, in which a relevant space of experimental parameters is explored. Then, we provide an account on current strategies to achieve such model selection, as well as a quantitative assessment of their performances. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of each algorithm (change-point analysis, STaSI, HaMMy, vbFRET, and ebFRET) with respect to accuracy, reproducibility, and computing time, which yields a range of algorithm-specific referential benchmarks for various data qualities. Data simulation and analysis were performed with our MATLAB-based multifunctional analysis software for handling smFRET data (MASH-FRET). </p>"},{"location":"publications/mash-fret/#histogram-analysis-and-bootstrapping","title":"Histogram analysis and bootstrapping","text":"<p>S.L.B K\u00f6nig, M.C.A.S.

Sigel, Plos One (2013) </p> <p>BOBA FRET: Bootstrap-Based Analysis of Single-Molecule FRET Data</p> <p>Time-binned single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments with surface-tethered nucleic acids or proteins permit to follow folding and catalysis of single molecules in real-time. Due to the intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in smFRET time traces, research over the past years has focused on the development of new methods to extract discrete states (conformations) from noisy data. However, limited observation time typically leads to pronounced cross-sample variability, i.e., single molecules display differences in the relative population of states and the corresponding conversion rates. Quantification of cross-sample variability is necessary to perform statistical testing in order to assess whether changes observed in response to an experimental parameter (metal ion concentration, the presence of a ligand, etc.) are significant. However, such hypothesis testing has been disregarded to date, precluding robust biological interpretation. Here, we address this problem by a bootstrap-based approach to estimate the experimental variability. Simulated time traces are presented to assess the robustness of the algorithm in conjunction with approaches commonly used in thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of time-binned smFRET data. Furthermore, a pair of functionally important sequences derived from the self-cleaving group II intron Sc.ai5\u03b3 (d3\u2019EBS1/IBS1) is used as a model system. Through statistical hypothesis testing, divalent metal ions are shown to have a statistically significant effect on both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of their interaction.

(2020) </p> <p>Metal ions and sugar puckering balance single-molecule kinetic heterogeneity in RNA and DNA tertiary contacts</p> <p>  The fidelity of group II intron self-splicing and retrohoming relies on long-range tertiary interactions between the intron and its flanking exons. By single-molecule FRET, we explore the binding kinetics of the most important, structurally conserved contact, the exon and intron binding site 1 (EBS1/IBS1). A comparison of RNA-RNA and RNA-DNA hybrid contacts identifies transient metal ion binding as a major source of kinetic heterogeneity which typically appears in the form of degenerate FRET states. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest a structural link between heterogeneity and the sugar conformation at the exon-intron binding interface. While Mg2+ ions lock the exon in place and give rise to long dwell times in the exon bound FRET state, sugar puckering alleviates this structural rigidity and likely promotes exon release. The interplay of sugar puckering and metal ion coordination may be an important mechanism to balance binding affinities of RNA and DNA interactions in general.</p> <p>B. P. Paudel, E. Fiorini, R.

Rueda PNAS (2018) </p> <p>Optimal molecular crowding accelerates group II intron folding and maximizes catalysis</p> <p>  Unlike in vivo conditions, group II intron ribozymes are known to require high magnesium(II) concentrations ([Mg2+]) and high temperatures (42 \u00b0C) for folding and catalysis in vitro. A possible explanation for this difference is the highly crowded cellular environment, which can be mimicked in vitro by macromolecular crowding agents. Here, we combined bulk activity assays and single-molecule F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) to study the influence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on catalysis and folding of the ribozyme. Our activity studies reveal that PEG reduces the [Mg2+] required, and we found an {\\textquotedbl}optimum{\\textquotedbl} [PEG] that yields maximum activity. smFRET experiments show that the most compact state population, the putative active state, increases with increasing [PEG]. Dynamic transitions between folded states also increase. Therefore, this study shows that optimal molecular crowding concentrations help the ribozyme not only to reach the native fold but also to increase its in vitro activity to approach that in physiological conditions.</p> <p>R.

It turned out that sample heterogeneity in structure and function of RNA molecules as well as folding intermediates, kinetic subpopulations, and interconversion rates of conformational states of RNA biomolecules, all of which are usually hidden in ensemble type experiments, are often observed characteristics. Besides proteins, metal ions play a crucial role in RNA folding and dynamics, as well as RNA/RNA or RNA/DNA interactions. RNA molecules form discrete conformational intermediates before reaching the native three-dimensional fold, whereby metal ions guide the folding pathway by changing the energetic barriers between local and global minima in the energy landscape. Here we review recent advances in the characterization of the role of metal ions in folding and function of nucleic acid structures by means of smFRET. Subsequently, the workflow of smFRET data analysis is described and exemplified by the metal ion-depending folding and dynamics of the group IIB intron from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and RNA\u2013RNA binding kinetics of this ribozyme's 5'-splice site formation.</p>"}]}
